Worldforge Hammer Script
------------------------
Tool for installing deps, checking out source, and compiling the application.
Execute hammer.sh for help.

All build artifacts are placed in the "work" directory.

Note: If you are building an AppImage, these scripts assumes that the 
AppImageKit source directory is installed in the same parent directory 
that the hammer directory is installed in.
